django-rated
============

A rate limiting middleware for Django

Introduction
============

rated allows you to limit the requests per hour a single client may attempt on views in 'realms' of your site.

You control which views are in which 'realm' by either decorating the view, or adding the url pattern into the realm map.

rated will keep track of how many requests, and when, a client has made and, if they've exceeded their limit, will return a 503 - Service Unavailable response.

Installing
==========

In your settings.py add to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:
    'rated.middleware.RatedMiddleware',

Then, add a RATED_REALMS dict.

There are three ways to apply rate limits.  Either decorate the view directly, add a realm with the same url pattern name, or map the url pattern name to a realm.

You can add mark a view as in the default realm simply:

    @rated_realm
    def myview(...)

To add it to a specific realm:

    @rated_realm(realm='other')
    def myview(...)

Otherwise, if the url pattern is named, and the name matches a realm name, it will be considered part of that realm.  There is also the RATED_REALM_MAP, which will map url pattern names to realm names.  The url pattern name is always mapped through here.
